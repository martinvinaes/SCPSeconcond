Replication materials for article "Economic conditions affect Support for Prime Minister parties in Scandinavia". Published in Scandinavian Political Studies.

This repository contains the following files:

1. `repliECVscandi.dta` - data from Scandinavian elections.
2. `repliECVscandi.do` - Stata code using data in 1. which produce tables 1, 2, S1 and figure 1. 
3. `repliECVdan.dta` - data from Danish vote function.
4. `repliECVdan.do` - Stata code using data in 3. which produce tables 3, 4, S2 and figure 2. 

Note that tables are produced in latex format, and the formatting is therefore a little different from that used in the article.
